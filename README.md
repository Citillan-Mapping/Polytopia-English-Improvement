# Polytopia-Language-Improvements
A consistenly updated version of the original JSON file used for making custom translations for the hit indie game 'The Battle of Polytopia'.

This includes a linguistic improvement to the default English language translation and a custom translation into my own personal connstructed language for the game, Polarisi.

This here package has been now rendered obsolete because of the removal of Custom Languages. nevertheless, this package will be availble and constantly updated, especially for older builds of Polytopia.
